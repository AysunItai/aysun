The provided React component, Sprite, is designed to render a specific
 frame from a sprite sheet onto a canvas element. It leverages React's 
 hooks for lifecycle management and state, 
and Recoil for state management within a React app. This component is
 optimized for performance by memoizing its output using React.memo, ensuring 
 that it only re-renders when its props change. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

Imports and Setup
It imports React essentials and hooks (useEffect, useRef).
CELL_SIZE is imported from a constants file, indicating the size of each 
cell (or sprite frame) within the sprite sheet.
useRecoilValue is imported from Recoil, a state management library for React,
 to access global state within the component.
spriteSheetImageAtom is a Recoil atom representing the sprite sheet image source. 
Atoms in Recoil are units of state.
Component Functionality
Props: The Sprite component accepts two props:
frameCoord: A string indicating the coordinates of the specific frame in the sprite 
sheet to be rendered, formatted as "xCoordxYCoord".
size: An optional size (with a default value of 16) that specifies 
the dimensions (width and height) of the canvas element and the frame to be drawn.
State Management: It uses the useRecoilValue hook to subscribe to the 
spriteSheetImageAtom atom, effectively re-rendering the component whenever the sprite sheet image changes.
Canvas Reference: A reference to the canvas element is created using the
 useRef hook, allowing direct manipulation of the canvas.
useEffect Hook
The component uses the useEffect hook to perform side effectsâ€”specifically, 
drawing the sprite frame onto the canvas whenever the sprite sheet image, frame coordinates, or size changes.
Inside the useEffect callback:
It accesses the canvas element and its 2D rendering context.
Clears the canvas to remove any previous drawings.
Parses the frameCoord prop to extract the X and Y coordinates of the frame on the sprite sheet.
Uses the drawImage method of the canvas's context to draw the specified frame from 
the sprite sheet onto the canvas. This process involves specifying the source image, 
the source coordinates, the source dimensions, and the destination coordinates and dimensions on the canvas.
Rendering and Optimization
The component renders a canvas element with the specified size for both its width and height. 
The canvas element is associated with the ref attribute linked to canvasRef for direct manipulation.
React.memo is used to wrap the Sprite component, creating MemoizedSprite. This higher-order component
 memoizes the output of Sprite, preventing unnecessary re-renders if the props (frameCoord and size) 
 and the sprite sheet image (through spriteSheetImageAtom) haven't changed.
Export
The memoized version of the component, MemoizedSprite, is exported for use elsewhere in the application
, ensuring that sprite rendering is efficient and only occurs when needed.
This setup is particularly useful in game development or any application requiring efficient, 
dynamic rendering of parts of an image (like a sprite sheet) based on changing state or props, 
without rerendering the entire component unnecessarily.
