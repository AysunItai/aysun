This JavaScript code defines a Camera class used in a game to manage the camera's position relative to the player's character, referred to here as the "Hero". 
The camera's purpose is to ensure that the Hero is always in view, with some added functionalities for movement and smoothness. Here's a breakdown of its components and functionalities:

Imports
It imports CELL_SIZE and direction constants (DIRECTION_RIGHT, DIRECTION_LEFT, DIRECTION_UP, DIRECTION_DOWN) from a relative path "../helpers/consts". These are likely constants that define the size of a game cell (a unit of space in the game world) and the possible directions the Hero can move.
Constants
CAMERA_SPEED: This constant defines how quickly the camera moves towards its destination. It's a fraction that represents a percentage of the distance moved per tick (a single update frame or cycle in the game loop).
CAMERA_LOOKAHEAD: This constant determines how far ahead of the Hero the camera should try to position itself when the Hero is moving, in terms of cell units.
USE_SMOOTH_CAMERA: A boolean flag that determines whether the camera should smoothly transition (interpolate) towards its destination position or snap directly to it.
Camera Class
The Camera class initializes with the game level it belongs to. It then calculates 
its initial position based on the Hero's position, adjusting it with a 
transformOffset to ensure the camera is centered or positioned correctly relative to the Hero.
transformX and transformY getters compute the CSS transform values to apply to 
the game view, ensuring the camera's view is centered on the camera's current 
position, offset by transformOffset.
static lerp method: A linear interpolation function used for smooth transitions. 
It gradually changes a value from one to another over time, used here to smoothly move the camera.
tick method: This method updates the camera's position each game tick (or frame).
 It checks the Hero's current position and moving direction to adjust the camera's destination. If the Hero is moving, it sets the camera's destination to a point ahead of the Hero in the direction of movement, applying the CAMERA_LOOKAHEAD multiplier. Depending on the USE_SMOOTH_CAMERA flag, it either smoothly interpolates the camera's current position to the destination (for a smooth camera effect) or directly sets it to the destination (for a static camera effect).
Functionality
When the game updates (on each tick), the camera checks the Hero's position and direction of movement.
If the Hero is moving, the camera positions itself ahead in the direction of 
movement to ensure the game view anticipates the Hero's path, enhancing player
 experience by showing where they are going next.
The smooth camera movement creates a more fluid visual experience, making the game
 feel more dynamic and less jarring than if the camera were to instantly jump to new positions.
In summary, this Camera class is responsible for dynamically adjusting the game's 
viewpoint based on the Hero's position and movement, with options for smooth transitioning to 
enhance the visual experience.
