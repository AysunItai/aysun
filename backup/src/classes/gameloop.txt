The JavaScript code snippet defines a GameLoop class designed to manage the game loop mechanism using the browser's requestAnimationFrame (raf) API. This class allows for executing a callback function at a stable, consistent rate, typically aimed at achieving a smooth 60 frames per second (fps) for game updates and rendering. Here's an explanation of its components and how it works:

Constructor
constructor(onStep): When a new instance of GameLoop is created, it requires a function onStep 
as an argument. This function is meant to be called every tick of the game loop (i.e., on every frame update). 
The constructor initializes properties and immediately starts the game loop by calling this.start().
Properties
onStep: A callback function that is called on each step (tick) of the game loop.
rafCallback: Stores the ID returned by requestAnimationFrame, used to cancel the request.
hasStopped: A boolean flag indicating whether the game loop has been stopped.
start Method
Initiates the game loop. It calculates the time difference (delta) between the current and previous 
frame timestamps, ensuring that onStep is called at a consistent interval
 corresponding to 60 updates per second (1/60th of a second per update).
It uses a while loop to account for any accumulated delta time that exceeds the fixed step interval, 
ensuring that onStep is called the correct number of times to maintain a steady update rate even if 
some frames take longer than expected.
Adjusts previousMs to account for the consumed time, ensuring smooth and consistent timing for updates.
Recursively calls requestAnimationFrame with tick to continue the loop, storing the callback ID in 
rafCallback for potential cancellation.
stop Method
Sets hasStopped to true and cancels the ongoing animation frame request using cancelAnimationFrame, 
effectively stopping the game loop.
Functionality and Use
The GameLoop class is designed to provide a reliable and efficient mechanism 
for running game or animation updates at a steady rate, aiming for smooth performance at 60 fps.
It abstracts the setup and management of the game loop, allowing developers to 
focus on the content of the onStep function (game logic, rendering, etc.) without
 worrying about the intricacies of time management and frame rate control.
By using requestAnimationFrame, the loop is optimized by the browser for performance
 and power efficiency, pausing when the tab or window is not visible to save resources.
In summary, this class is a utility for creating smooth and efficient animations or 
game loops in web applications, ensuring that the game updates and renders at a consistent rate, 
adapted to the browser's refresh rate.
