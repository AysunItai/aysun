We will also need to make new monsters in the game that have stats attached to them, 
like in the monsters.is file I gave you. We can copy the code for existing monsters 
and add a new name and sprite sheet for their animation, then get them stats.

Then we need to set a close combat range where the player is able to attack 
a monster within that range. If within range, the player can click a monster to 
attack and deal damage to its health based on the damage stat of the weapon, 
Plus additional damage for strength. Letâ€™s say each five strength equals one more damage. 
And the starting weapon does 10 to 20 damage.


While React can be used for simple games, handling complex animations, numerous entities, 
and real-time interactions often calls for a more dedicated game development framework or library, 
such as Phaser.js for web games. React's re-rendering can introduce performance bottlenecks 
for more intensive games, and managing game state can become cumbersome as complexity grows.

Hi Aysun. I meant to still use ciabattas revenge as a base and add to it. 
It has a levels file where you can add in game objects like enemies and walls. 

import {
  LEVEL_THEMES,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_FLOUR,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_GOAL,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_HERO,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_WALL,
  // PLACEMENT_TYPE_LOCK,
  // PLACEMENT_TYPE_KEY,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_ICE,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_WATER,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_FIRE,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_CONVEYOR,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_WATER_PICKUP,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_ICE_PICKUP,
  // PLACEMENT_TYPE_ROAMING_ENEMY,
  // PLACEMENT_TYPE_GROUND_ENEMY,
  // PLACEMENT_TYPE_FLYING_ENEMY,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_FIRE_PICKUP,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_SWITCH_DOOR,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_SWITCH,
  PLACEMENT_TYPE_TELEPORT,
  //PLACEMENT_TYPE_THIEF,
  //PLACEMENT_TYPE_CIABATTA,
} from "../helpers/consts";

const level = {
  theme: LEVEL_THEMES.GREEN,
  tilesWidth: 50,
  tilesHeight: 50,
  placements: [
    { x: 5, y: 5, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_HERO },
    { x: 7, y: 4, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_GOAL },

    //{ x: 3, y: 1, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_CIABATTA },
    { x: 5, y: 1, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_FIRE },

    { x: 3, y: 2, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_TELEPORT },
    { x: 7, y: 6, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_TELEPORT },

    { x: 7, y: 3, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_SWITCH_DOOR, isRaised: false },
    { x: 4, y: 3, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_SWITCH_DOOR, isRaised: true },
    { x: 4, y: 2, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_SWITCH },

    { x: 8, y: 2, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_WALL },
    { x: 8, y: 3, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_FLOUR },

    { x: 1, y: 4, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_CONVEYOR, direction: "DOWN" },
    { x: 1, y: 5, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_CONVEYOR, direction: "DOWN" },

    { x: 3, y: 4, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_FIRE },
    { x: 4, y: 4, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_FIRE_PICKUP },
    { x: 5, y: 4, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_FIRE },

    { x: 4, y: 7, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_ICE_PICKUP },
    { x: 3, y: 6, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_ICE, corner: "TOP_LEFT" },
    { x: 3, y: 7, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_ICE },
    { x: 3, y: 8, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_ICE, corner: "BOTTOM_LEFT" },
    { x: 5, y: 6, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_ICE, corner: "TOP_RIGHT" },
    { x: 5, y: 7, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_ICE },
    { x: 5, y: 8, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_ICE, corner: "BOTTOM_RIGHT" },

    { x: 6, y: 8, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_WATER_PICKUP },
    { x: 7, y: 8, type: PLACEMENT_TYPE_WATER },
  ],
};

export default level;

I was thinking for now just to edit the demolevel1 and add in the enemies,    // PLACEMENT_TYPE_ROAMING_ENEMY,
  // PLACEMENT_TYPE_GROUND_ENEMY,
  // PLACEMENT_TYPE_FLYING_ENEMY,

Then edit the spritesheet provided in the game to add in additional sprites, 
but for now still use the ones provided

Other things to work on:
Add a tree placement using provided sprite so it can be easily added to the map
Enemies drop a random amount of gold (different amounts for each monster, e.g 1-5 for bat, 2-10 for goblin)
Player can click on a defeated enemy to open their loot and take it
